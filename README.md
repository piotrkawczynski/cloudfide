## Project

Due to a little misunderstanding of the task I have added a database.
In the recording I described the errors that can be caused by using a database in fetching tasks.
I have also mentioned about how I would extend the functionalities in the future.

```bash
# setup project
docker compose run --rm api npm i
```

```bash
# run project
docker compose up
```
